Generate the Invoice

Table: Products

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| product_id  | int  |
| price       | int  |
+-------------+------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table shows the ID of a product and the price of one unit.


Table: Purchases

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| invoice_id  | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| quantity    | int  |
+-------------+------+
(invoice_id, product_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row in this table shows the quantity ordered from one product in an invoice.


Write an SQL query to show the details of the invoice with the highest price. If two or more invoices have the same price, return the details of the one with the smallest invoice_id.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is shown in the following example.



Example 1:

Input:
Products table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 1          | 100   |
| 2          | 200   |
+------------+-------+
Purchases table:
+------------+------------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | quantity |
+------------+------------+----------+
| 1          | 1          | 2        |
| 3          | 2          | 1        |
| 2          | 2          | 3        |
| 2          | 1          | 4        |
| 4          | 1          | 10       |
+------------+------------+----------+
Output:
+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | quantity | price |
+------------+----------+-------+
| 2          | 3        | 600   |
| 1          | 4        | 400   |
+------------+----------+-------+
Explanation:
Invoice 1: price = (2 * 100) = $200
Invoice 2: price = (4 * 100) + (3 * 200) = $1000
Invoice 3: price = (1 * 200) = $200
Invoice 4: price = (10 * 100) = $1000

The highest price is $1000, and the invoices with the highest prices are 2 and 4. We return the details of the one with the smallest ID, which is invoice 2.

with sum_cte as (
  select p1.invoice_id, p1.product_id, p1.quantity, p1.quantity * p2.price as price
  from Purchases p1 inner join product p2 on p1.product_id = p2.product_id
),
rank_cte as (
  select invoice_id, rank() over (order by sum(price) desc) as rnk
  from sum_cte
  group by invoice_id
)
min_inv as (
  select min(invoice_id)
  from rank_cte
  where rnk = 1
)

select product_id, quantity, price
from sum_cte
where invoice_id in (select * from min_inv);

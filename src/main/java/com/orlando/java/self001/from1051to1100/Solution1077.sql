+————-+————-+
| 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 2 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 |
+————-+————-+

Employee table:
+————-+——–+——————+
| employee_id | name | experience_years |
+————-+——–+——————+
| 1 | Khaled | 3 |
| 2 | Ali | 2 |
| 3 | John | 3 |
| 4 | Doe | 2 |
+————-+——–+——————+

Result table:
+————-+—————+
| project_id | employee_id |
+————-+—————+
| 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 1 |
+————-+—————+

Both employees with id 1 and 3 have the most experience among the employees of the first project. For the second project, the employee with id 1 has the most experience.
